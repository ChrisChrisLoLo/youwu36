## About
36 key gasket mounted ortholinear keyboard that can be used with the miryoku layout. More details will come as design stabilizes. 

## Status
The current PCBs work! I'm am now confident enough to start rolling out build instructions, case files, and qmk software

## Handwired
There is a handwired case available that I'm fairly happy with. You can find it in the `./case` directory
